The Temperature Converter is a user-friendly web application that allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius, 
Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units. It features a minimalistic design with an input field where you can enter the temperature
value and a dropdown menu to select the unit of the input temperature.

To perform the conversion, simply enter a temperature value and select the corresponding unit. Click the
"Convert" button, and the website will display the converted temperature in the remaining two units below the button.
